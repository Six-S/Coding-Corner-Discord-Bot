# Coding-Corner-Discord-Bot
A quick little Discord bot written in Python.

This is a small project that makes use of [Rapptz's Discord API Wrapper](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) to add some cool functionality to my Discord Server.

The current iteration of this bot features a community driven reputation system. Users can allocate points to one another for good deeds, helpful advice, etc.

### Notes:

Usage: $[Command]

Command List:
    1. $ping - Make sure CodeBot is around
    2. $list - Show this list
    3. $register - Register yourself with CodeBot
    4. $addrep [user] - Give another user a reputation point
    5. $showrep [user] - Show the reputation of a user

More to come!
Feel free to take this and use it if you want.
Setting up the enviornment is nothing - just make sure you've installed the correct discord library.
